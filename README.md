## Getting Started

Hi Jeason,
Just recreated the UI and FB login (Chats and post not included).
Follow this section `Create Facebook OAuth app` in this article(https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-use-nextauth-js-for-client-side-authentication-in-next-js/) and create facebook Appid and secret here (https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)

Once you got the id and secret paste those values in the .env.local file. That's it you are ready to go.

To run the development server:

```bash
Clone this repo
npm install
npm run dev

```
